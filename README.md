Proud of Your Progress Cards
Overview
Proud of Your Progress Cards is a web application that allows users to generate personalized certificates of achievement. Users can input their name, a personalized message, and the course name to create a customized certificate. The certificate is displayed in a modal window, providing a visually appealing and interactive way to celebrate accomplishments.

Experience
Building Proud of Your Progress Cards was a rewarding experience that helped me strengthen my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I learned how to dynamically generate content based on user input, create modal windows for displaying information, and validate form inputs. Overall, it was a great project that allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical and creative way.

What I Learned
How to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to create dynamic content.
How to use CSS to style elements and create visually appealing designs.
How to validate form inputs to ensure data integrity and user experience.
Challenges
One of the main challenges I faced was implementing the modal functionality and ensuring it worked correctly with the form submission. Styling the certificate to be visually appealing while maintaining a professional look was also a challenge. Additionally, ensuring the code was structured and maintainable posed some difficulties.

Future Improvements
Add more styling options to customize the certificate's appearance further.
Implement a feature to download the certificate as a PDF.
Enhance the user interface for a more interactive and engaging experience.
